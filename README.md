# Scaledrone Chat App

Continuation of the final project for [Front-end Developer course](https://www.algebra.hr/cjelozivotno-obrazovanje/programi/front-end-developer/) at [Algebra University College](https://www.algebra.hr/). I wanted to keep the original project as it was when I submitted it. You can find the original [here](https://github.com/dominoto/fe-seminar). This one will have some further changes.

The task was to write a web chat application with a functional user interface for chat participants, and to upload the created code to GitHub.

The mentioned chat application should:
- be able to create new text messages
- press enter or click on the "send" message button (display it on the screen next to the author's name)
- for each participant in the chat, select a random color and/or name that identifies them
- connect to the Scaledrone service and successfully simulate the conversation of all active users
- be available through a public GitHub account

Used technologies: HTML, CSS, React, Scaledrone API, gh-pages.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
